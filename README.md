# Squirrels in the City

###### Final Project for CS 171 (Data Visualization Class at Harvard) 
Dataset: The 2018 Squirrel Census 
<br/> Team Members: Iris Su, Lizzy Ling, and Jada Lee

###### Our Code:
We wrote all the code in the codebase EXCEPT FOR: /slick, js/leaflet, js/slick, lines 121-261 in walk_map_vis.js (commented in file).
<br> For the sentiment vis, Lizzy used a separate python package and then uploaded the resulting CSV to the data folder.
<br> We also drew nearly all the images on our website!

###### Libraries Used:
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap (basic CSS)</li>
<li>FullPage (HTML structure)</li>
<li>Slick (carousel)</li>
<li>Leaflet (map)</li>
<li>Leaflet-Draw (allows for drawing on map)</li>
<li>Point-in-polygon (checks if a coordinate is within a multipolygon GEOJson object)</li>
</ul>
